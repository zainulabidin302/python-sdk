# A React demo with FacePlusPlus 

There are two parts of this demo. 
 1. A Python API (with flask)
 2. A front end Ract App.

Here, I will discuss the backend which is the api part. For front end, click here.

# Flask API for FacePlusPlus

FacePlusPlus is a face recognition and detection api which provides easy to use rest api and mobile sdk. Here in this demo, I have created an api with the help of flask, which will send images to FacePlusPlus server for anylisis.

# How it works

To run this demo server, you need to install the following python packages. Everything is tested under python2.7.

 * Flask
 * flask-cors

Once you have these packages installed via pip, you can run the app like this.

`python app.py`

(assuming that python is pointing to python2

If you have any questions, create an issue.
